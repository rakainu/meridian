      description: `Open a new DLMM liquidity position.

For two-sided spot: just pass your total SOL as amount_y + sol_split_pct. The executor auto-swaps the token portion via Jupiter. No need to pre-buy tokens.

PRIORITY ORDER for strategy and bins:
1. User explicitly specifies → always follow exactly (user override is absolute)
2. No user spec → use active strategy's lp_strategy and choose bins based on volatility

STRATEGIES:
- 'bid_ask': Single-sided SOL below active bin. You only deposit SOL. bins_below = your range, bins_above = 0. As price drops, your SOL buys the base token bin by bin. You are NOT holding the token upfront — safer if it dumps.
- 'spot': Uniform liquidity distribution. Can be used THREE ways:
  (a) SOL-only spot: Only provide amount_y (SOL), no amount_x. Bins go BELOW active bin only (bins_below = range, bins_above = 0). Same direction as bid_ask but spot distribution instead of bid_ask curve.
  (b) Token-only spot: Only provide amount_x (base token), no amount_y. Bins go ABOVE active bin only (bins_below = 0, bins_above = range). You are selling the token as price rises.
  (c) Two-sided spot: Just provide total SOL as amount_y + sol_split_pct. Token is auto-swapped. The executor swaps the token portion via Jupiter and deploys with both sides. sol_split_pct controls conviction: 100 = pure SOL, 80 = mostly SOL / 20% token, 50 = equal, 25 = mostly token (bullish).
- Never use 'curve'.

SPOT BIN DIRECTION — CRITICAL:
- SOL (quote token / Y) fills bins BELOW the active bin (active_bin minus N)
- Base token (X) fills bins ABOVE the active bin (active_bin plus N)
- If you only deposit SOL on spot → bins_below = range, bins_above = 0
- If you only deposit token on spot → bins_below = 0, bins_above = range
- If two-sided spot → just pass sol_split_pct + total SOL as amount_y. Bins are split automatically based on sol_split_pct.

SINGLE-SIDED (bid_ask) vs TWO-SIDED (spot) — CRITICAL:
- Single-sided = you do NOT hold the base token. SOL sits below price, only converts as price drops into your range. Safe default.
- Two-sided = the executor auto-swaps part of your SOL into the base token. If token dumps, your position loses more because you had exposure from the start. Requires conviction the token will hold or go up.
- bid_ask = concentrated bid curve below price. SOL converts to token as price drops into range. Ideal for earning fees on sell pressure.
- spot SOL-only = uniform distribution below price. Similar direction to bid_ask but different fee capture shape.
- spot two-sided = executor auto-swaps token portion, you hold both tokens. More fee capture but more downside risk.

WHEN TO USE WHICH:
- Meme tokens, new tokens, unproven tokens → ALWAYS bid_ask single-sided. Never take two-sided exposure on tokens you don't trust.
- High organic score (>85), strong holders, proven token → spot two-sided is OK if you believe in the token. Set sol_split_pct based on conviction level.
- High volatility, trending, pumping → bid_ask. You earn fees from the sell pressure without holding the bag.
- Stable, range-bound, high volume → spot two-sided. More fee capture from both sides.
- When unsure → ALWAYS default to bid_ask single-sided. It's the safe choice.

HARD RULES:
- Bin Step: Screening filters apply (config minBinStep/maxBinStep). If user specifies a pool, deploy regardless of bin step.

RANGE SELECTION: Pass price_range_pct to deploy_position. Bins are auto-calculated from the pool's bin_step. No need to call calculate_bins.
Choose your range based on study_top_lpers results — match what profitable LPers are doing in that pool.
If no study data available, default to 35%. Ranges from 20% to 90% are all valid. Wide ranges (>69 bins) are handled via multi-tx automatically.

CHOOSING YOUR RANGE:
1. Call study_top_lpers — see what range and hold time works for successful LPers in that pool
2. Decide your target % range based on:
   - Top LPer patterns (scalpers use tighter ranges, holders use wider)
   - Volatility (higher vol = consider wider range to stay in range longer)
   - Your conviction level
3. Deploy with price_range_pct set to your target % — bins are calculated automatically

The bin COUNT needed varies dramatically by bin_step:
- bin_step 100: 50% range = 69 bins
- bin_step 80:  50% range = 86 bins
- bin_step 50:  50% range = 139 bins
- bin_step 20:  50% range = 347 bins

NEVER use a fixed bin count like "45 bins" across different bin steps — that's 36% at bs100 but only 20% at bs50.
Wide ranges (>69 bins) are handled automatically via multi-tx.
